    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I am a back-end developer based in Lagos, Nigeria.
            <br>I am a result-oriented software engineer dedicated to creating, maintaining, testing, and debugging
            components and features on the server-side.
            <br>This includes the core application logic, databases, data and application integration, API, and other
            processes taking place behind the scenes of a front-end application or system.
        </p>
        <p>When I am not coding, I am writing articles related to software development. My technical articles can be
            found
            on https://linktr.ee/marynoir</p>
